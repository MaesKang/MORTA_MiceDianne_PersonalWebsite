			<h1>Packet Sniffing can be Ethical</h1>

WHAT IS ETHICS?</br>
If we look in an old dictionary we find the following definition:</br>
"the science of human duty; the body of rules of duty drawn from this science; a particular system of principles and rules concerning duty,
whether true or false; rules of practice in respect to a single class of human actions; as, political or social ethics; medical ethics
and today computer ethics. Ethics is the reasoning that we do in order to make decisions that will not violate our conscience.
As the Greeks would say, "to keep one's soul pure".

There are two categories of ethical theories :</br></br>
1.TELEOLOGICAL

</br>
2. DEONTOLOGICAL</br>

The use of computers has become a important in modern society. As technology advances, more people relies on their computers even for personal matters. There are many concerns today for both ethical and legal issues of computer use. Ethics is the art of doing what is right in a societal context, and computer users are a part of such a context in the world of cyberspace. Unethical use of computers involves violation of privacy using intrusive software and disrespect of other users. Music and file sharing is considered unethical, but it is debatable whether it is illegal or not. However, unethical uses can lead to illegal acts; for example, using spyware to obtain information from other users is considered unethical, and also unlawful. Music and File Sharing The ethicality and legality of music and file sharing is often debated.</br></br>

What is Packet Sniffing ?</br></br>
It can be good and it can be bad. This technology can also sniff out personal information like email accounts, passwords and a lot of other information to. Thats why people now days understand why securing or encrypting your data is so important.There are so many pocket sniffers.Packet sniffing can happen anytime to your computer when ever you get help from the trouble boost and they try to fix your computer. While that is happening the sniffers can look at any information they want, so we better look out for these kind of stuff.

A packet sniffer is a computer program or a piece of computer hardware that can pass over a digital network or a part of the network.</br></br>

What does Sniffer mean?</br>
A sniffer (packet sniffer) is a tool that intercepts data flowing in a network. If computers are connected to a local are network that is not filtered or switched, the traffic can be broadcast to all computers contained in the same segment. This doesn’t generally occur, since computers are generally told to ignore all the comings and goings of traffic from other computers. However, in the case of a sniffer, all traffic is shared when the sniffer software commands the Network Interface Card (NIC) to stop ignoring the traffic. The NIC is put into promiscuous mode, and it reads communications between computers within a particular segment. This allows the sniffer to seize everything that is flowing in the network, which can lead to the unauthorized access of sensitive data. A packet sniffer can take the form of either a hardware or software solution.

A sniffer is also known as a packet analyzer.

While sniffers do not cause network damage, they have the potential to cause personal harm because they can allow a hacker to confiscate PINs, passwords and other confidential information, especially data that is in plain text. Sniffer users can even include co-workers who seek to benefit from unauthorized data searches within a work setting. This risk is compounded by the fact that a sniffer program is relatively inexpensive to purchase and easy to use.

There are ethical reasons to use sniffer software, such as when a network administrator monitors network traffic flow. Anti-sniff scans are useful when guarding against sniffer attacks, as are switched networks. However, when one considers how easy it is to obtain and use sniffer software for malicious reasons, its illegitimate use is a cause for concern.
