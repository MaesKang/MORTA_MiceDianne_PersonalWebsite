    For Internet users who relentlessly bullied Chris Lao for his viral equivalent of a “blonde moment,” Gonzalez asked whether those same attackers would be as willing to be as vicious in person. Doubtful, she answered.

She also said that some people used to post terrible words as if they can say it face-to-face .They might gain many followers and give impression to others on who they are but eventually they will know what type of person they really are.Be true and be decent.People use status updates to share what’s on their minds, to tell others what they’re doing, and to gather feedback from friends.

Social media sites had been the major source of entertainment for people around the globe.Since, Facebook is a global social networking site available in various languages, country and language is not a barrier. Also, with the Facebook translation feature, you will never miss out on connecting with Facebook users from different countries and with people who speaks different languages.Facebook timeline gives a completely new look in terms of your personal profile branding. With the Facebook timeline cover, you can easily create your first impression or you can be creative and you can use the cover pic to tell people about yourself. Also, you can set your certain updates as public and if done strategically, you can use it as your portfolio.</br>

FACEBOOK HELPS BUSINESSES 

For example, if you want people to recognize you as a Facebook business expert (provided you are one),  you can set privacy to public for your most commented and liked “Facebook for business tips, articles and discussions”. This way all your new profile visitors will see your expertise, and will be connecting with you because of your useful and targeted updates. This will also help you to get more subscribers and also help you to get clients as well.</br>

DISADVANTAGES 

One of the most prominent disadvantages of Facebook is your privacy on Facebook. Later on Facebook simplified the Facebook privacy, but still many newbie make mistakes by publishing private images and status update publicly. Also, people usually keep their Facebook friend list visible to public, and this helps Facebook stalkers to find more information about you. You can read our guide on how to hide Facebook friend list from others.Many users still don’t use Facebook list feature which is very helpful to keep your status updates targeted to specific friend list, like College friends, Office friends and so on. I’m sure you might not like to get fired from your job because of silly status updates against your boss or office.

Nothing is safe on the internet these days and people need to be more aware of the things they post online.
