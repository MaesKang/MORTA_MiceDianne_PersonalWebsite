			<h1>HOW TO SAVE HUMANITY</h1>

<center>
<p>

Most of us already know the meaning of ethics but doesn't know or even care about its importance in our life.

But what if someone or "something" will arrive and what if that someone or "something" doesn't have that much idea with
the concept of ethics and does something unethical.</br>
</br>

It was a good night for me and I was about to sleep when I heard of something unusual and that sounds very annoying and disturbing but because I need to be early for tomorrows exam I had forced myself to sleep and try to forget about the noise that I have heard.But because of curiosity ,I decided to went outside my house and find out where the noise came from .Then I saw something that really caught my eye.</br>

I saw the spaceship landed.Then I went near it and saw a creature,an unbelievable creature.It was two feet high, and green., and shaped like plumber's friends. Their suction cups were on the ground, and their shafts, which were extremely flexible, usually pointed to the sky. At the top of each shaft was a little hand with a green eye in its palm. The creatures were friendly, and they could see in four dimensions. It took me a minute before I realized what was IT.It was a Tralfamadorian from planet Tralfamadore.How did I know? I have read a book earlier this day and it's about The Tralfamadores.I turn back and run as fast as I could but the alien suddenly appear in front of me.I was about to shout to call for a help when it started to talk to me .</br>

"Don't be afraid."The alien said .</br>
" How come I wouldn't be afraid ?You're ..You are an alien !And you can speak like a human!"

</br>
"Yeah.I'm an alien.And I can speak like a human because of the chip that I put at my back."
</br>


"What?wait.. did you invent that ?"</br>


"no! it was my father's invention.We will use this to conquer the earth ."</br>

"WHAT?? why would you do that?"

</br>
"Because everything we want is what we get.We want to take over your world."

</br>
"Are you out of your mind?This planet is ours.If you do that,many of us will suffer.Where's your humanity?"

</br>
"I'm not a human either that's why I don't have any idea on what humanity is."</br>

"Don't you have that thing called "ethics?"</br>


"Is that a food?I want to have that"</br>


"It's not a food !It's a requirement for human life.Without it,everything will be ruined.

"
</br>
It is our means of deciding a course of action. Without it, our actions would be random and aimless. There would be no way to work towards a goal because there would be no way to pick between a limitless number of goals. Even with an ethical standard, we may be unable to pursue our goals with the possibility of success. To the degree which a rational ethical standard is taken, we are able to correctly organize our goals and actions to accomplish our most important values. Any flaw in our ethics will reduce our ability to be successful in our endeavors." I said with a loud voice,tryin' to make it understand all those words that came out from my mouth.</br>

"You know what ,I may not really understand all those stuffs that you've said but I get the idea and your point.This planet is lucky to have you.Well maybe it's time to go ,I also have a mission to accomplish."</br>

"What mission?"</br>

"To teach the others.."</br>


"on what?"</br>


"I want to teach them all those things that you've said.Thanks for being a friend."

</br>
Then I fell from my bed and realized that it was all just a dream.

</br></br>

Lucky it was just a dream :)
