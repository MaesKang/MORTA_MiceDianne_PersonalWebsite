Violence is a very big issue nowadays and it comes in many forms.

Violence is defined as "the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation", but acknowledges that the inclusion of "the use of power" in its definition expands on the conventional meaning of the word. This initial categorization differentiates between violence a person inflicts upon himself or herself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, military groups and terrorist organizations. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence)

So can you imagine yourself being a part of something big where you can help and save many lives?



I am working as a programmer for a certain and big software development company.Then one day ,a law enforcement agency commissioned our company to develop several websites. The purpose of those websites is to gather information in relation to individuals who may be interested in extreme forms of violence. And here's the big thing, I'll be the one who will be in charge of assisting the feds to secretly gather information in relation to people who peruse the sites.

As a professional programmer,I am not against of their idea because I know that this will be very a big help for many people. I know that many people will be worried about their privacy when they find out that this thing could be possible.But our action will be guided by certain rules.

Data and the personal identities of individual participants in research studies must be kept confidential. There should be careful supervision of staff to make sure that they, too, are adhering to best practices in protecting the confidentiality of all participant data. Some reasonable precautions to protect and respect the confidentiality of participants include

disseminating research findings without disclosing personal identifying information;
storing research records securely and limiting access to authorized personnel only;
removing, disguising, or coding personal identifying information;
obtaining written informed consent from the participant (or, in the case of a child, the parent or guardian) to disseminate findings that include photographic/video images or audio voice recordings that might reveal personal identifying information.
Because legal requirements in this area are very strict and because institutions monitor research on human subjects very carefully, professionals should seek further guidance directly from the appropriate personnel in their home institutions.

During the peer review of submitted manuscripts, all findings, information, and graphics in the manuscripts must be treated as highly confidential, and reviewers and editors alike have an obligation to protect findings from any form of premature disclosure. In a blind-review process, the identities of the researchers must be protected. In a double-blind review process, the anonymity of authors and reviewers alike must be scrupulously preserved. Editors and reviewers should make no prepublication use of information they learn from submitted manuscripts. 

Identity Theft,Cyberstalking, and Child Pornography are the top computer crimes in our generation. 

Internet’s not a place without crime, but it’s also not a place where you’re helpless.  There’s lots you can do to protect yourself and your family on the Internet.
